# Iris

Iris is a modular, extensible, real-time IoT backend. It receives data from devices and pipes it through a customizable process line. Write services that run analytics, save the data to a database, send it somewhere else, etc. Or combine a buch of existing plugins to build the ultimate data flow. Iris gives you total freedom with the peace of mind of a stable, rock solid foundation.

While Iris' strength lies in swallowing up loads of real-time data, it can also send responses back. Spin up an API to query the data, send commands to the devices... the possibilities are endless.
