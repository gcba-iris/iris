Iris is a tiny framework for building fast, modular, extensible IoT backends. Assemble data processing flows in a Gulp-like fashion using third-party plugins, or write your own. Start the app. That's it.

Iris tries to strike a balance between convention vs configuration. It comes with sane defaults and a plugin system that makes it easy to get started, while still allowing for a great deal of flexibility.


```bash
$ npm install gcba-iris/iris -g

```
